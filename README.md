Welcome to the [HCB](https://hackclub.com/fiscal-sponsorship/) codebase. We are so excited to have you. With your help, we can make HCB the best platform to run a nonprofit.

## What is HCB?

HCB is a powerful, safe, and easy-to-use fiscal sponsorship platform for hackathons, Hack Clubs, robotic teams and more. We use it to run our [fiscal sponsorship program](https://hackclub.com/fiscal-sponsorship/), we provide high schoolers with a 501(c)(3) status-backed restricted fund for their organization. Behind the scenes, HCB is a Ruby on Rails application (learn more by reading [our documentation](/dev-docs)).

## I found a security vulnerability! What should I do?

Please email [hcb-security@hackclub.com](mailto:hcb-security@hackclub.com) to report the vulnerability. We currently don't have a bug bounty program but, as a token of appreciation, we'd love to mail you a t-shirt and give you a shoutout on our GitHub.

## Quick start

To run HCB in a development environment, follow the setup instructions in our [documentation](/dev-docs/development.md). We support development through Codespaces, Docker, and a native setup.

All contributors are expected to follow the Hack Club [Code of Conduct](https://hackclub.com/conduct) and Hack Club's [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/hackclub/hackclub/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).
