    Hack Club Bank currently uses a service called
    <a class="info" href="https://www.expensify.com" target="_blank">Expensify</a>
    to streamline your reimbursement process. Expensify allows
    you to upload receipts and receive reimbursements back
    into your bank account 🏦.

        <p>
        We'll invite whoever needs to be reimbursed (let's call them "Max") to Expensify through their email address.
        When Max receives the email, they'll make an account or log into Expensify, where they can upload their
        receipts as "expenses," and submit their expenses in a "Report."
        </p>
        <p>
        When Max submits a report, Hack Club Bank will receive it, make sure that the numbers make sense,
        and approve the reimbursement. Max will get a couple of emails letting them know that the expense was approved,
        and the reimbursement is on their way!
        </p>
        <p>
        To receive the reimbursement, Max will need to connect their bank account with Expensify. They'll need to do it
        only once, and for future reimbursements, the funds will arrive in their bank account within a few days.

        <p>
        Usually, no. We ask that you make all reimbursements through Expensify on Hack Club Bank because Expensify makes it
        easy for us as a nonprofit to keep track of receipts and expenses in an auditable way.
        </p>

        If you think you have an exceptional case where using Expensify isn't sensible, feel free to get in touch with

        <strong>How long does it take to be reimbursed?</strong>
      </summary>

        <p>
        If the reimbursee has a bank account connected to Expensify, they'll receive the reimbursement within a few days of
        its approval. If they need to connect their bank account to Expensify, that may take a couple of extra days at most.

        <strong>Can I reimburse someone for a part of an expense?</strong>
      </summary>
      <article>
        <p>
        Yep! When you submit your receipts to get reimbursed on Expensify, just make sure the expense amount is the
        partial reimbursement amount rather than the full expense. Also, add a note there that it's a partial reimbursement.
