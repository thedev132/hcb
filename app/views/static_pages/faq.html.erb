          <p>
          Yes! Hack Club Bank started as a tool for hackathon organizers, but
          today, we work with a spectrum of events, projects, and
          organizations related to science, technology, entrepreneurship, and
          education. Chances are, you’ll be eligble to use Hack Club Bank!

            Hack Club Bank accepts paper checks! Just mail the check to our
            billing address:

            Be sure that your organization's name is included either on the
            check's memo or somewhere else in the envelope sent. Without it, we
            can't properly route received funds.
          </p>

          <p>
            Checks <strong>must be made out to either "The Hack Foundation" or
            "Hack Club"</strong>. Silicon Valley Bank, our banking partner,
            unfortunately rejects checks made out to any name besides those
            two. This is out of our control.

          Hack Club Bank’s 501(c)(3) nonprofit status comes from <a
          href="https://hackclub.com">Hack Club</a>, which is legally
          registered as The Hack Foundation. Our EIN, which is the same as

          If your card is lost or stolen, we can deactivate the card. Please
          get in touch with the Bank team
					<% if organizer_signed_in? %>
						(<%= help_message %>)

						<span class="muted">(sign in to view)</span>
					<% end%>
					as soon as possible. In the meantime, please freeze your
					card within the Hack Club Bank dashboard. If your card
					expires, you can freeze the card and issue yourself a new
					card through the Hack Club Bank dashboard—Hack Club Bank
					cards do not auto-renew when they pass their expiry date.

          <h3 class="inline mb1">I keep getting emails about uploading receipts when I make a purchase using a card. Do I have to upload receipts?</h3>
        </summary>
        <article>
          <p>
          Yes. The IRS requires all nonprofits to keep receipts for purposes
          on file. Additionally, nonprofits following best practices
          regularly hire auditors to ensure their books are in order. Missing
          receipts lead to failed audits.
          </p>
          <p>
          Continually not uploading receipts for purchases is grounds for
          termination of fiscal sponsorship under Hack Club Bank, as it puts
          Hack Club and everyone else partnering with Hack Club Bank's
          501(c)(3) status at risk.

            Our sponsor wants to pay through Bill.com or something other than invoices through Stripe

          <p>
          We can accommodate whichever method the sponsor would like to use, including
          proprietary "supplier systems" that larger companies may use to pay their bills.
          These methods usually require that they connect and pay directly to Hack Club Bank’s
          underlying bank account (not Stripe’s invoicing system), so please contact the Bank team

          <p>
          Yes, you’re not locked into the name or Google Workspace domain you
          used to set up your Hack Club Bank account. However, currently,
          changing your project name is a fairly involved process on our
          backend, so you’re only able to change your name up to twice every
          year. If you need to change your name or domain more frequently,
          please contact the Bank team.
