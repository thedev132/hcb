  <h1>Brand Guidelines</h1>
  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    Hey folks! 👋 From logos to phrasing, we want to make sure you and your team feel confident sharing about Hack Club / HCB on your site, fundraising platforms, grant apps, and other online spaces.
  </p>
  <p>
    We know you're eager to share about your nonprofit status through HCB. 🤗 Following brand guidelines will not only help you display an accurate relationship with Hack Club but will also help create a unified appearance amongst all fiscally sponsored projects and legitimize your status.

<div class="our-name">
  <h2>Our Name</h2>
  <p>When using our name, please make sure to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Capitalize every letter of HCB</li>
    <li>Refrain from adding/removing additional characters and words (e.g. 'Hack Club HCB')</li>
    <li>Refrain from using our previous name, "Hack Club Bank".</li>
  </ul>
  <%= render partial: "callout", locals: { type: "warning", emoji: "⚠️", title: "As a reminder, HCB is not a bank! We are a fiscal sponsorship platform backed on Increase and Bank of America. When you sign the fiscal sponsorship agreement, a “restricted fund” - a privatized section of these bank accounts for your team only - is created for your organization through our platform." } %>
  <%= render partial: "callout", locals: { type: "info", emoji: "ℹ️", title: "When using HCB in legal settings, use HCB, a project by The Hack Foundation (d.b.a. Hack Club) OR The Hack Foundation (d.b.a. Hack Club)." } %>
</div>

<div class="fiscal-sponsorship" id="fiscal-sponsorship">
  <h2>Fiscal Sponsorship</h2>
  <p>
    As an event or organization fiscally sponsored through HCB, the following can be included on any correspondence, websites, marketing, etc.:
  </p>
  <pre><code>
<%= @event_name %> is fiscally sponsored by The Hack Foundation (d.b.a. Hack Club), a 501(c)(3) nonprofit (EIN: 81-2908499).
  </code></pre>
  <p>
    If you'd like to modify the above statement, make sure it clearly shares that you're fiscally sponsored by HCB. If you have questions or would like to run your phrasing by us, feel free to <%= link_to "contact the HCB team", "mailto:hcb@hackclub.com" %>.
  </p>
  <%= render partial: "callout", locals: { type: "warning", emoji: "⚠️", title: "Fiscal sponsor ≠ sponsor or donor. Unless you have received direct financial support from us, please do NOT use this reference as your organization's relationship to HCB." } %>
  <%= render partial: "callout", locals: { type: "warning", emoji: "⚠️", title: "Misrepresenting your relationship with HCB or Hack Club could result in the termination of your fiscal sponsorship agreement." } %>
