<p>Hi there,</p>

<p>
  Welcome to your new Google Workspace account for <%= @event %>! The first time you sign into your account, you can use these credentials:
</p>

<pre>
  username: <%= @address %>
  password: <%= @password %>
</pre>

<p>
  You can <a href="https://accounts.google.com/signin/v2/identifier?continue=https%3A%2F%2Fmail.google.com&Email=<%= CGI.escape @address %>&passive=true">sign in to your account now</a>. After you do, it may be a good idea to change your password as well :)
</p>

  Best,<br/>
