      This revocation was initiated because your organization's Google Workspace accounts appear to be inactive, or you do not have any accounts created. Accounts are considered inactive if they haven't been used in 180 days. If you'd like to keep your Google Workspace access, please log in to at least one account before the scheduled revocation date. If you no longer need Google Workspace access, We ask that you do not log into your accounts and allow the revocation to proceed.
    <% elsif @g_suite.revocation.because_of_invalid_dns? %>
      This revocation was initiated because your organization's domain, <%= @g_suite.domain %>, has invalid or missing DNS records required by Google Workspace. If you'd like to keep your Google Workspace access, please verify your domain's DNS records. Once your domain is verified, you'll get an email that confirms the revocation has been canceled. If you no longer need Google Workspace access, we ask that you do not verify your domain and allow the revocation to proceed.
